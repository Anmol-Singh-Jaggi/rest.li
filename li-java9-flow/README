This module contains "Flow.java" extracted from Java 9 source code. This allows us to use the new Flow
streaming interfaces such as Publisher and Subscriber etc without introducing dependency on Java 9 in Pegasus
and Rest.li applications now.

# Source
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev/jdk/file/f80fadfa33c3/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/concurrent/Flow.java

# Modification
Java compiler prohibits any source file with package "java.*", we have to modified the package name from:
"java.util.concurrent" to "com.linkedin.java.util.concurrent". This is temporarily until we fully adopt Java 9.

TODO: Remove this module entirely once we are fully migrated to Java 9
